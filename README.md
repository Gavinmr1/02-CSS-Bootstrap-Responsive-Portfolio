# Unit 08 Project 1 Homework: Professional Materials

Using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap I have made a portfolio page about myself and my work. This site contains a contact page with my information, an about page with a description of me and my goals and interests, and a portfolio page with examples of some of my best work. on the portfolio page there are screenshots and links with a brief description of the project. Attached at the footer are three links to my LinkedIn, Github, and Resume.
